=head1 NAME

Test::HTTP::LocalServer - spawn a local HTTP server for testing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use HTTP::Tiny;
  my $server = Test::HTTP::LocalServer->spawn;

  my $res = HTTP::Tiny->new->get( $server->url );
  print $res->{content};

  $server->stop;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a tiny web server suitable for running "live" tests
of HTTP clients against it. It also takes care of cleaning C<%ENV> from settings
that influence the use of a local proxy etc.

Use this web server if you write an HTTP client and want to exercise its
behaviour in your test suite without talking to the outside world.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<Test::HTTP::LocalServer-E<gt>spawn %ARGS>

  my $server = Test::HTTP::LocalServer->spawn;

This spawns a new HTTP server. The server will stay running until

  $server->stop

is called. Ideally, you explicitly call C<< ->stop >> or use

  undef $server

before the main program ends so that the program exit code reflects the
real exit code and not the chlid exit code.

Valid arguments are :

=over 4

=item *

C<< html => >> scalar containing the page to be served

=item *

C<< file => >> filename containing the page to be served

=item *

C<<  debug => 1 >> to make the spawned server output debug information

=item *

C<<  eval => >> string that will get evaluated per request in the server

Try to avoid characters that are special to the shell, especially quotes.
A good idea for a slow server would be

  eval => sleep+10

=back

All served HTML will have the first %s replaced by the current location.

The following entries will be removed from C<%ENV> when making a request:

    HTTP_PROXY
    http_proxy
    HTTP_PROXY_ALL
    http_proxy_all
    HTTPS_PROXY
    https_proxy
    CGI_HTTP_PROXY
    ALL_PROXY
    all_proxy

=head2 C<< $server->port >>

This returns the port of the current server. As new instances
will most likely run under a different port, this is convenient
if you need to compare results from two runs.

=cut

sub port {
  carp __PACKAGE__ . "::port called without a server" unless $_[0]->server_url;
  $_[0]->server_url->port
};

=head2 C<< $server->url >>

This returns the L<URI> where you can contact the server. This url
is valid until the C<$server> goes out of scope or you call

  $server->stop;

The returned object is a copy that you can modify at your leisure.

=cut

sub url {
  $_[0]->server_url->abs
};

=head2 C<< $server->server_url >>

This returns the L<URI> object of the server URL. Use L</$server-E<gt>url> instead.
Use this object if you want to modify the hostname or other properties of the
server object.

Consider this basically an emergency accessor. In about every case,
using C<< ->url() >> does what you want.

=cut

sub server_url {
  $_[0]->{_server_url}
};

=head2 C<< $server->stop >>

This stops the server process by requesting a special
url.

=cut

sub stop {
    local $?; # so we don't override the exit code of a child here
    get( $_[0]->server_url() . "quit_server" );
    undef $_[0]->{_server_url};
    my $pid = delete $_[0]->{_pid};
    waitpid $pid, 0;
    #my $retries = 10;
    #while(--$retries and CORE::kill( 0 => $_[0]->{ _pid } )) {
        #warn "Waiting for '$_[0]->{ _pid }'";
        #sleep 1; # to give the child a chance to go away
    #};
    #if( ! $retries ) {
        #$_[0]->kill;
    #};
};

=head2 C<< $server->kill >>

This kills the server process via C<kill>. The log
cannot be retrieved then.

=cut

sub kill {
  my $pid = delete $_[0]->{_pid};
  if( $pid and CORE::kill( 0 => $pid )) {
    local $?; # so we don't override the exit code of a child here

    # The kid is still alive
    CORE::kill( 'KILL' => $pid )
        or warn "Couldn't kill pid '$pid': $!";
    waitpid $pid, 0;
  };
  undef $_[0]->{_server_url};
};

=head2 C<< $server->get_log >>

This returns the
output of the server process. This output will be a list of
all requests made to the server concatenated together
as a string.

=cut

sub get_log {
  my ($self) = @_;
  return get( $self->server_url() . "get_server_log" );
};

sub DESTROY {
  $_[0]->stop if $_[0]->server_url;
  for my $file (@{$_[0]->{delete}}) {
    unlink $file or warn "Couldn't remove tempfile $file : $!\n";
  };
  if( $_[0]->{_pid } and CORE::kill( 0 => $_[0]->{_pid })) {
      $_[0]->kill; # boom
  };
};

=head2 C<< $server->local >>

  my $url = $server->local('foo.html');
  # file:///.../foo.html

Returns an URL for a local file which will be read and served
by the webserver. The filename must
be a relative filename relative to the location of the current
program.

=cut

sub local {
    my ($self, $htmlfile) = @_;
    require File::Spec;
    my $fn= File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute( $htmlfile )
          ? $htmlfile
          : File::Spec->rel2abs(
                 File::Spec->catfile(dirname($0),$htmlfile),
                 Cwd::getcwd(),
             );
    $fn =~ s!\\!/!g; # fakey "make file:// URL"

    $self->local_abs($fn)
}

=head1 URLs implemented by the server

=head2 arbitrary content C<< $server->content($html) >>

  $server->content(<<'HTML');
      <script>alert("Hello World");</script>
  HTML

The URL will contain the HTML as supplied. This is convenient for supplying
Javascript or special URL to your user agent.

=head2 download C<< $server->download($name) >>

This URL will send a file with a C<Content-Disposition> header and indicate
the suggested filename as passed in.

=head2 302 redirect C<< $server->redirect($target) >>

This URL will issue a redirect to C<$target>. No special care is taken
towards URL-decoding C<$target> as not to complicate the server code.
You need to be wary about issuing requests with escaped URL parameters.

=head2 401 basic authentication challenge C<< $server->basic_auth($user, $pass) >>

This URL will issue a 401 basic authentication challenge. The expected user
and password are encoded in the URL.

    my $challenge_url = $server->basic_auth('foo','secret');
    my $wrong_pw = URI->new( $challenge_url );
    $wrong_pw->userinfo('foo:hunter2');
    $res = HTTP::Tiny->new->get($wrong_pw);
    is $res->{status}, 401, "We get the challenge with a wrong user/password";

=head2 404 error C<< $server->error_notfound($target) >>

This URL will response with status code 404.

=head2 Timeout C<< $server->error_timeout($seconds) >>

This URL will send a 599 error after C<$seconds> seconds.

=head2 Timeout+close C<< $server->error_close($seconds) >>

This URL will send nothing and close the connection after C<$seconds> seconds.

=head2 Error in response content C<< $server->error_after_headers >>

This URL will send headers for a successful response but will close the
socket with an error after 2 blocks of 16 spaces have been sent.

=head2 Chunked response C<< $server->chunked >>

This URL will return 5 blocks of 16 spaces at a rate of one block per second
in a chunked response.

=head2 Surprisingly large bzip2 encoded response C<< $server->bzip2 >>

This URL will return a short HTTP response that expands to 16M body.

=head2 Surprisingly large gzip encoded response C<< $server->gzip >>

This URL will return a short HTTP response that expands to 16M body.

=head2 Other URLs

All other URLs will echo back the cookies and query parameters.
