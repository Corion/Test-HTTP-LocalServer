Test::HTTP::LocalServer - spawn a local HTTP server for testing

DESCRIPTION

This module implements a tiny web server suitable for running "live" tests
of HTTP clients against it. It also takes care of cleaning C<%ENV> from settings
that influence the use of a local proxy etc.

Use this web server if you write an HTTP client and want to exercise its
behaviour in your test suite without talking to the outside world.
